# 1. Which implementation was easier and why? 
#    - It was quite hard to implement program #1 (without functions), as you had to figure out
#      all the factors to have the program up and running. However, the function program (#2) was
#      not easier to be fully honest, but on the other hand it is much more readable and
#      easiser to understand afterwards.
# 2. Which implementation is more readable and why?
#    - As stated in answer number 1, the second program is easier to understand as you are
#      dividing the overall problem into smaller sectors. Thereby making it more readable.
# 3. Which problems in the first implementations were you able to solve 
#    with the latter implementation?
#    - To categories the print operations of the program, so when the user of the program
#      has entered a valid direction, the program gives the next direction easily without
#      writting the code again (def printed(route)).
#      With that, you could make another function that defines what the user types in, and
#      thereby return the direction he/she wants to go next.
#      All that was left to do then, is to create the while-loop to run the program sufficiently,
#      as well as to use the functions created within the loop.
